      <h2>What is the author trying to teach?</h2>
      <p>
        The author is trying to inform readers about mental health awareness<br />
        and its healing process through Ellery Stevens' point of view. It
        reflects<br />
        on the complexities of life after loss and the importance of finding
        joy.<br />

      <h2>My Personal Takeaway</h2>
      <p>
        My personal takeaway is that, it's easier to find ways to cope with<br />
        grief rather than shoving it inside. Love can have an impact on a
        person's<br />
        life when it comes to making difficult decisions.
